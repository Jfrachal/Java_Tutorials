// A method example. If we were to call this we'd have to provide a number parameter and it would return nothing.
public     | void        | test        | (int a)
Visibility | Return Type | Method Name | Parameters
 
// !! Remember that class constructor methods don't have a return type specified!
// !! public className() { }
 
Variable Declaration: // Just declaring a variable
    // Remember in declaration, just as in method naming, the variable can be named literally anything.
    // Also remember that if we were to try to use one of these variables-
    // -without assigning it a value it WILL return null. (Except for booleans which default false)
    int a;
    String hello;
    boolean toBe;
    Object object;
 
Variable Assignment: // Just assigning a variable a value.
    a = 1234;
    hello = "Hello, world!";
    toBe = false;
    object = new Object();
 
Declaration AND Assignment: // Declaring and assigning immediately.
    int a = 1234;
    String hello = "Hello, world!";
    boolean toBe = false;
    Object object = new Object();
 
Operators: // Operators generally used in condition checks (if/else statements)
    // Relational
        == // Value is equal to.
        != // Value is NOT equal to.
        <= // Value is LESS than or equal to.
        >= // Value is GREATER than or equal to.
        >  // Value is GREATER than.
        <  // Value is LESS than.
    // Logical
        !  // Not.
        && // Conditional AND.
        || // Conditional OR.
        &  // and.
        |  // orur.
